I am so used to alt-ctrl-] and alt-crl-[ to switch between tabs (this is osx default keyboard shortcut) and I wanted the same when using Chrome on a non-osx (e.g. chromeos) device so this extension does that.

Except you can't bind to the [ or ] keys, so it uses 9 and 0 instead.

So this will make alt-ctrl-9 and alt-ctrl-0 switch to prev/next tab in the current window.
