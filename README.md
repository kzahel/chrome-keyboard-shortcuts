I am so used to alt-shift-] and alt-shift-[ to switch between tabs (this is osx default keyboard shortcut) and I wanted the same when using Chrome on a non-osx (e.g. chromeos) device so this extension does that.

Except you can't bind to the ] or [ keys, so it uses 9 and 0 instead.

So this will make alt-shift-9 and alt-shift-0 switch to prev/next tab in the current window.
